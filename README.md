# cookie_upgrader

## Name

It's about the session, right, not the cookie? So ... session rotator is a better name? (Like below).

## Other Options

- https://github.com/fac/hestia - MonkeyPunches into SignedJar, but I'm not sure that's always used in all cases.
- https://github.com/envato/rails_session_key_rotator - Works as middleware, but is it too simple? Will it work with Rails 4?
